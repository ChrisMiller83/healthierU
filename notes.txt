clients are giong to belong to one coach
coach can have many clients
clients are going to have coach id
workouts and meals are also giong to have coach id
workouts and nutrition have to be linked to coach and client and best way to do it is through coach id

workouts table needs client id and coach id

coach makes workouts in database
how does coach assign workouts to client? 

make seperate client view page for coach and allow them to assign workouts to them?
render workouts (based on category) and let coach pick or just type from scratch

could copy and paste workout text from database into workout field and then assign it to client from there
on cilck "assign" take field text and put it in as client "workout" text

want clients id attached to workout 

workout table {
  name
  type of workout
  add coachid 

  static associrate*models) {
    Workout.belongsTo(models.Client) - what is it getting assigned to
    Workout.hasMany(models.Point) - assigning pionts if we choose to do so)
  }
}

parent table {
  statis associate(models) {
    
  }
}
